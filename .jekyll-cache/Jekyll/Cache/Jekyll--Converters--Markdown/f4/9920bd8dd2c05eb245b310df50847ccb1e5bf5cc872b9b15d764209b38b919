  <li>Opinions are classified into groups using graph clustering based on the response patterns<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">2</a></sup>.</li>
  <li>The group labels (i.e., coding) are determined by us, based on the classified opinion texts.</li>
  <li>No annotation has been performed in the present analysis. Thatâ€™s why we have groups of overlapped contents (<em>Economy</em> and <em>COVID-19 &amp; Economy</em>) and there are few misclassified opinions.</li>
